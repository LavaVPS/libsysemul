# PHPUnit wrapper for Solano CI

solano-phpunit provides a wrapper to allow [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)
tests to be run in parallel across multiple workers. See the config directory
for an example of how solano-phpunit is tested on Solano CI.

# Solano CI

[Solano CI](https://www.solanolabs.com) is a hosted continuous deployment
platform that runs your build and test suites in the cloud, in parallel.
Your tests run isolated in freshly prepared workers that are automatically
configured with real database and search engine instances to match your
development and production environments.
